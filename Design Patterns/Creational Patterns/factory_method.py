# Factory Method is a creation design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
# but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

# Usage examples: The Factory Method pattern is widely used in Python code. Itâ€™s very useful when you need to provide
# a high level of flexibility for your code.

# Identification: Factory methods can be recognized by creation methods that construct objects from concrete classes.
# While concrete classes are used during the object creation, the return type of the factory methods is usually
# declared as either an abstract class or an interface.
