# Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
# Usage examples: The Adapter pattern is pretty common in Python code. Itâ€™s very often used in systems based on some legacy code. In such cases, Adapters make legacy code work with modern classes.

# Identification: Adapter is recognizable by a constructor which takes an instance of a different abstract/interface type. When the adapter receives a call to any of its methods, it translates parameters to the appropriate format and then directs the call to one or several methods of the wrapped object.
